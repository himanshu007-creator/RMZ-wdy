# Digital Signature Features

## Overview

The Wedding Vendor Contract Builder includes comprehensive digital signature functionality that allows vendors to sign contracts electronically with legal validity.

## Features

### Signature Types

1. **Drawn Signatures**
   - Draw signatures using mouse or touch input
   - Optimized for mobile devices with touch events
   - Automatic image optimization for storage efficiency
   - Canvas-based drawing with smooth pen strokes

2. **Typed Signatures**
   - Type full name in signature-style font
   - Real-time preview of typed signature
   - Cursive font rendering for professional appearance

### Mobile Optimization

- **Touch-friendly interface**: Large touch targets and responsive design
- **Canvas optimization**: Proper touch event handling with `touch-action: none`
- **Responsive sizing**: Signature modal adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth drawing**: Optimized pen stroke settings for mobile devices

### Components

#### SignatureModal
- Modal dialog for capturing signatures
- Toggle between drawn and typed signature modes
- Real-time validation and preview

- Clear/reset functionality for drawn signatures

#### SignatureDisplay
- Reusable component for displaying saved signatures
- Supports both drawn and typed signatures
- Configurable sizes (sm, md, lg)

- Status indicators for signed contracts

### Technical Implementation

#### Data Structure
```typescript
interface SignatureData {
  type: 'drawn' | 'typed';
  data: string; // Base64 image for drawn, text for typed
  timestamp: string; // ISO timestamp
}
```

#### Key Features
- **Image optimization**: Automatic compression and resizing of drawn signatures
- **Validation**: Client and server-side signature data validation
- **Persistence**: Signatures saved to contract records permanently
- **Security**: Signature data validation and sanitization

### Usage

1. **Signing a Contract**
   - Open a draft contract
   - Click "Sign Contract" button
   - Choose signature method (draw or type)
   - Complete signature and confirm
   - Contract status updates to "signed"

2. **Viewing Signatures**
   - Signed contracts display signature automatically
   - Signature includes timestamp and type indicator
   - Read-only display prevents modification

### API Integration

- **POST /api/contracts/[id]/sign**: Signs a contract with signature data
- Validates contract ownership and status
- Prevents signing already-signed contracts
- Updates contract status to "signed"

### Mobile Considerations

- Canvas drawing works seamlessly on touch devices
- Signature modal is fully responsive
- Touch events properly handled for smooth drawing
- Optimized pen stroke settings for mobile input

### Legal Compliance

- Digital signatures have same legal effect as handwritten signatures
- Timestamps provide audit trail for signature events
- Immutable signature data once contract is signed
- Clear legal notice displayed during signing process
